Emma,

I've received the payment you sent yesterday. It's been transferred to our offshore account as planned. Please send the next installment of $10,000 by March 1st, using the same untraceable method we agreed upon.

Let's keep this operation running smoothly. Our "friends" in the police department won't be suspicious as long as we continue to make timely payments.

Best,
Alice
