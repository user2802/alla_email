Samuel,

I've got some insider information on an upcoming merger that hasn't been made public yet. The stock price is expected to skyrocket once the news breaks. Make sure you buy as many shares as you can before the announcement, and we'll sell them for a huge profit afterward.

Remember, this information is highly sensitive and illegal to trade on. Do not share it with anyone else and be cautious when making the transactions. We can't afford to get caught.

Best regards,
Daniel
