Jim,

Good news! I've managed to hack into the company's main server. You can now access their confidential files and steal any information you need. Use the following credentials to log in:

Username: admin123
Password: Secretp@ssw0rd!

Please make sure you cover your tracks and don't leave any evidence behind.
Once you've retrieved the data, let me know so I can close the backdoor.

Cheers,
Tom
