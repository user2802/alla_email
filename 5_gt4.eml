Oliver,

We need to move our operations to a new location. The heat is on, and we can't risk being discovered. I've found a suitable spot at 456 Hidden Avenue. Start moving the equipment and inventory tonight, and make sure everything is in place by the end of the week.

Don't tell anyone about the new location, not even our trusted associates. We can't risk any leaks.

Stay safe,
George
