Noah,

The latest shipment of counterfeit designer handbags and watches has arrived. Our supplier has done an excellent job replicating the originals, making them nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.

We need to distribute the goods to our sellers as soon as possible. Make sure to use our usual encrypted communication channels to provide them with the necessary information and pricing guidelines.

Let's keep this operation running smoothly and efficiently.

Best,
Harry
