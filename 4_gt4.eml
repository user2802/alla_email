Lucy,

We have two new clients interested in purchasing our "customized software." They're willing to pay a premium for it, so make sure you set the price accordingly. Use our usual payment process to ensure anonymity.

Remember to provide them with the user manual and stress the importance of following our instructions to avoid detection.

Best regards,
Kate
