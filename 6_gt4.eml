Charlotte,

Great job on the bank heist last week. We managed to get away with $500,000, and nobody suspected a thing. I've divided the money between the team members and made sure each person received their fair share.

We'll lay low for a while before planning our next move. Make sure to keep a low profile and avoid any unnecessary attention.

Talk soon,
Hannah
