Jack,

Our contact has confirmed the availability of the rare painting we discussed last month. They've managed to "acquire" it without raising any suspicion. The price is $1,000,000, and they expect payment in untraceable cryptocurrency.

Once you've made the payment, I'll arrange for the painting to be delivered to our secure storage facility. As always, make sure to cover your tracks and avoid any digital traces that could lead back to us.

Best regards,
Lily
