Ruby,

Our new ransomware variant is ready for deployment. The encryption algorithm has been improved, and we've added some new evasion techniques to avoid detection by antivirus software. We should be able to target more victims with this version and increase our revenue.

Start spreading the ransomware through our usual phishing campaigns and exploit kits. Make sure the ransom demands are clear and provide victims with instructions on how to pay us in cryptocurrency.

Keep an eye on our bitcoin wallets for incoming payments, and let me know if there are any issues.

Good luck,
Max
